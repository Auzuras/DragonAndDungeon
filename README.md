# DragonAndDungeon
Python project: **Level 1**

This project was an introduction to the Python programming language. We had **3** days to implement a small console game.

This part was done solo. Due to lack of time, the project's code and architecture are far from good.

## More information:
The project uses Python 3.7.7 and can be openned with a Visual Studio 2022 solution.

Do not hesitate to play the game with the console in full screen.
